## Overview of the Project

### project: FRAUD DETECTION IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS

### Objective 
The objective of the fraud detection system is to identify anomalous financial transactions using machine learning techniques like Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor for early detection of fraudulent activities.

### Key activities
1)**Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the financial transaction dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical variables.

2)**Anomaly Detection:** Implement Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) to detect fraudulent transactions by identifying anomalies in transaction patterns.

3)**Visualization and Analysis:** Visualize the anomalies in transaction amounts and account balances, and analyze the detected fraudulent activities to derive actionable insights.

### Key points
1)**Anomaly Detection:** Used Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor to detect fraudulent transactions by identifying outliers in financial data.

2)**Model Results:** Both models identified anomalies in transaction amounts, frequency, and account balance, marking them as potential fraud cases.

3)**Insights:** Anomalies were flagged in specific transaction types and amounts, enabling targeted fraud prevention strategies.

### Key Insights
1)High Transaction Amounts flagged as potential anomalies.

2)Frequent Login Attempts correlated with suspicious activity.

3)Combined Methods enhanced detection accuracy.
